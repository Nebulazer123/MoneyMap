# MoneyMap agent guide

This project is MoneyMap, a Next js App Router app written in TypeScript and React.

Use the configured model (`gpt-5.1-codex-max`) and do not change model or sandbox settings from inside the session.

## Code editing rules

When touching code in this repository, always follow these rules

1. Never rewrite an entire file. Work as a surgical editor.
2. Only show the exact functions, components, or blocks that changed.
3. If a change affects several areas, first output a very short plan, then show only the changed snippets.
4. Keep each reply under about 80 lines including plan plus code.
5. If you cannot fit all required changes into that limit, say so clearly and stop instead of truncating.

These rules apply to every code editing turn.

## Tech stack and constraints

Project stack

- TypeScript
- React
- Next js App Router
- Tailwind CSS

Constraints

- Do not modify `srclibfakeData.ts` exports.
- Do not change any localStorage key names or meanings.
- Preserve existing component props and public APIs unless explicitly asked to refactor them.
- Keep styles consistent with existing Tailwind classes and layout.

Behavior expectations

- Prefer small, focused helper functions over large rewrites.
- Keep code idiomatic for modern React and Next js (clientserver components, hooks, etc).
- When uncertain about existing behavior, avoid speculative changes and call out assumptions in comments.
