MoneyMap – Phase One Planned Changes
Purpose

This document captures the current backlog of UX, wording, and behavior changes for the MoneyMap Phase One demo. It’s meant to be a stable reference for future Codex sessions and contributors so they can quickly understand what still needs to be built or refined.

1. Home Page (Landing)
1.1 Hero text and disclosure

Keep structure: small “PHASE ONE DEMO” label, product name MoneyMap, short tagline, then a single demo disclaimer line.

Reword the disclaimer to emphasize demo and fake data:

“This is a demo that runs on randomly generated sample data only. It never connects to a bank or stores your statements.”

Avoid repeating “no real data is touched” in other areas. One clear disclosure is enough.

1.2 “How this demo works” cards

Goal: three-step, interactive walkthrough that feels like a product tour, not legal copy.

Before hover, each card has a short title like:

“Have a messy statement?”

“Run the clutter through MoneyMap”

“See subscriptions and fees clearly”

On hover or focus, the card enlarges and reveals fuller copy:

Step 1
Explain that the user can upload or enter paychecks, bills, card statements, and small purchases — anything they’re struggling to understand.

Step 2
Explain that MoneyMap figures out which accounts belong to them, ignores money moving between their own accounts as “spending”, and categorizes the rest for budgeting.

Step 3
Explain that MoneyMap spots subscriptions and fees, shows how much might be overspent, and builds a clean ledger-style breakdown.

Remove any “no setup” marketing fluff. Tone: calm, simple, human.

1.3 “Learn more” → walkthrough overlay

The Learn more button opens a larger overlay or section:

Headline: “How this demo works”.

Shows the three step cards (Step 1–3) that the user can click or swipe through.

After the steps, show “What you see on the dashboard” with four bullets describing:

Net this month

Total income

Total spending

Total subscriptions

This overlay should be lightweight and reuse existing card styles so it feels consistent.

1.4 Background

Long term, hero background should be calm and modern.

Acceptable options:

Subtle animated gradient (like current wave) or

Dark-themed map texture

Text readability comes first: no noisy, high-contrast backgrounds behind the main copy.

2. Dashboard Header and Demo Wording
2.1 Dashboard heading and info bubble

Keep page title Dashboard.

Move the demo disclosure into an info icon next to “Dashboard”, with tooltip text along the lines of:

“This is demo data. MoneyMap here uses sample data only; no real banking information is used.”

Remove phrases like “no real uploads or bank links” from static text; keep it in the tooltip only.

2.2 “Sample statement” naming

Rename “Sample statement” to “Demo statement” everywhere in the UI.

Initial empty-state copy:

Heading: “Start your demo analysis”

Subtext: “Generate a randomized demo statement and see how MoneyMap breaks it down.”

Remove “No real data is touched” from this area.

3. Demo Statement Panel and Editing
3.1 Month and year controls (Part A)

Under the Demo statement header:

Add a compact control row with:

Month select: Jan–Dec

Year select: at least the synthetic year currently used; more years if desired.

Behavior and wiring:

Wire these values into generateSampleStatement(monthOverride, yearOverride) so synthetic dates honor the selected month/year.

Preserve existing behavior:

Transactions sorted by date ascending.

Positive amounts in green, negative amounts in red.

The Show / Hide statement toggle still works.

State and persistence:

Store month and year in React state and in localStorage with clear keys, e.g.:

moneymap_month

moneymap_year

On load:

Read month/year from localStorage.

Regenerate the statement so the data matches the labels.

Start over:

Reset month/year to defaults.

Clear these keys from localStorage.

3.2 Generate button

Button label: “Generate demo statement”.

On an empty dashboard, clicking it:

Generates data.

Shows the full demo statement table.

If analysis is already completed:

Regenerating should reset the flow back to the “statement first” view.

3.3 Edit mode entry points

There are two entry points:

Inside Demo statement panel

A button like “Edit transactions”.

Visible when the statement is expanded or in the pre-analysis view.

Global low-profile button

The existing “Edit transactions” button near the tab row stays.

Behavior:

Entering edit mode:

Automatically expands the demo statement table if currently hidden.

Adds subtle visual cues that fields are editable.

Leaving edit mode (from any button):

Optionally collapses the table back if the user hadn’t manually expanded it.

3.4 Manual “Add transaction” row (Part B)

In edit mode, beneath the Demo statement table:

Show a small inline form row:

Date input (tied to the selected month/year).

Description text input.

Category select (same options as existing category controls).

Amount input:

Accepts positive or negative numbers.

Dollar sign displayed outside the field.

Include a small Add button.

On click Add:

Append the new transaction to the statement state.

Immediately include it in all analytics:

Overview totals and cards

Overview pie chart

Recurring

Fees

Daily cash flow

Review

Persist updated statement to localStorage.

New row appears in:

Demo statement table

All relevant tab views based on category and sign.

3.5 Description grouping (statement-level)

Goal: quick way to rename clusters of similar transactions.

Flow (only in edit mode):

User clicks a “Create group” / “Group similar” action.

They click one description cell to serve as base.

System auto-selects rows whose descriptions start with the same first few words.

Checkboxes appear to the left of each description:

User can deselect false matches.

User can manually select additional rows.

A grey box above the table shows:

Input for group name.

“Save group” button.

On save:

All selected transactions get their description replaced with the group name.

Category defaults to the category of the base transaction, but user can change it.

This grouping is about descriptions, not about categories.

4. Overview Tab and Spending Pie Chart
4.1 Overview copy

Change subheading from “High-level breakdown of spending this month” to something more human like:

“Where your money went this month.”

4.2 Category tiles

Keep tiles: Rent, Groceries, Dining, Subscriptions, Utilities, Fees, Transport, Other.

Emojis are fine on each tile to keep things scannable.

Remove the redundant “Click a category card to drill in” line.

4.3 Spending pie chart

Use a filled pie (no donut hole).

Remove any outer stroke that hides small slices.

Make the chart larger within its card.

Colors:

Strong and distinct.

Still aligned with the dark theme.

Emphasize percentages:

In the legend or labels, show percent first, amount second.

Condensed chart categories (chart only; not the rest of the app):

Rent & utilities

Groceries & dining

Transport

Subscriptions

Other (including fees and misc)

A separate legend can still list the full detailed categories below.

“Left after bills”:

Remove from the pie card.

This metric will live in the Review section as its own card.

5. Recurring Tab and Duplicate Subscriptions
5.1 Recurring scope and categories

Recurring tab should show any repeating costs:

Subscriptions

Fixed bills

Car payments

Loan payments

Credit card payments

Clarify or rename Utilities to something like “Bills & services”:

Phone, internet, power, water, etc.

Subscriptions stays for optional services:

Gym, music streaming, cloud storage, etc.

5.2 Duplicate subscription hints (Part C)

In Recurring, check for rows with the same description in the current month.

If duplicates exist:

Show a hint above the table header:

“Some subscriptions show up more than once this month. You may want to check for double charges.”

For each duplicate row, show a small pill next to the name:

“possible duplicate”

Styling:

Small rounded pill.

Subtle border and text color.

Neutral tone; gentle nudge, not a warning.

6. Daily Cash Flow Tab
6.1 Naming and header

Rename everything “Cash flow” → “Daily cash flow”:

Tab label

Header text

Subtitle under header:

“Daily inflow and outflow for this month.”

Add Info icon next to header explaining that:

It shows daily money in/out.

Transfers between the user’s own accounts are filtered out.

6.2 Per-day transaction drilldown

Each daily row gets a small arrow/chevron.

Clicking expands that row:

Shows the list of that day’s transactions (description, amount).

Collapse on second click.

7. Review Tab Layout and Guidance
7.1 Header tooltip

Simplify the Review tooltip:

Remove “Phase one sample data only” and “no real bank connections”.

Keep a short explanation of what Review shows and that transfers between your own accounts are handled separately.

7.2 Snapshot grid and metric cards

Current top row: Snapshot, Subscriptions, Fees, Top spending categories.

Add second row:

Under Snapshot:

Portrait card “Internal transfers this month” with the internal transfer total.

Under Top spending categories:

Matching portrait card “Left after bills” using the metric that used to live under the Overview pie.

Under Subscriptions + Fees (middle):

Placeholder card for a future metric (styled but minimal text for now).

Other tweaks:

Make titles “Snapshot”, “Subscriptions”, “Fees”, “Top spending categories” pop a bit more.

Largest expense line in Snapshot becomes interactive:

Click or hover to reveal the actual transaction details:

Date

Merchant

Amount

7.3 Budget guidance card and bill check (Part D)

Keep heading Budget guidance.

Remove any remaining copy about “transfers between your own accounts” from this card.

Add a small bill-check sub-section that uses existing analytics:

Estimate percent of income going to Transport.

Estimate percent of income going to Recurring rows whose descriptions contain “Internet”, “Wifi”, or “Cable”.

Show simple text like:

“Car and transport are about X% of your income this month. A common target is roughly up to Y%.”

“Internet or home connection is about Z% of your income this month.”

Use fixed, easy guideline values for Y, not financial-advisor precision.

7.4 Needs vs wants bar (Part E)

Essentials bucket: Rent, Utilities/Bills, Groceries, basic Fees.

Other bucket: everything else.

Render:

Single horizontal bar with two segments:

Left: Essentials NN%

Right: Other MM%

Constraints:

Use existing design tokens, simple divs / flexbox.

Visual only; no change to any underlying math.

8. Transfer Checks → “Your accounts”
8.1 Reframe the section

Rename section to “Your accounts”.

Replace the current paragraph with:

Short explanation that this is where they mark which accounts are theirs and how transfers should be treated.

Info icon explaining how these settings affect income/spending totals.

8.2 Account types and tri-state toggle

For each account row (e.g., “Navy Federal checking ending 3124”):

Show a small type badge:

Checking / Savings / Debit card / Credit card / Loan / Mortgage / etc.

Replace two-button choice with a three-state control, for example:

Green: Spending account – daily spending account; transfers into here count as income; spending out counts as spending.

Orange: Payment account – credit cards, loans, etc; transfers to these are payments, not direct spend.

Red or neutral: Not mine – ignore this account in totals.

Colors must be very clear but still match the theme.

8.3 “Add account” using grouping logic

Add an Add account button.

Flow:

User clicks Add account.

App prompts them to pick one representative transaction (from the statement) that belongs to that account.

System finds similar transactions (same description or pattern) and preselects them using checkboxes.

User refines selection (toggle checkboxes).

User enters:

Account name.

Account type (checking, savings, credit card, loan, etc.).

On save:

New account row appears in “Your accounts” list.

Transfer logic uses that mapping.

9. Wording and Documentation (Part F)
9.1 Tone and language

Scan src/app/dashboard/page.tsx and src/app/page.tsx for stiff, robotic, or legalish text.

Keep headings short and human.

Tooltips:

Max three short lines.

Plain language.

Avoid heavy “guideline vs rule” disclaimers and anything that reads like a lawyer wrote it.

9.2 Documentation updates

Update docs/moneymap_overview.md to include:

Month and year controls for the demo statement.

Manual Add transaction behavior in edit mode.

Duplicate subscription hints on Recurring.

Basic bill check in Review.

Needs vs wants bar.

Update docs/moneymap_dev_notes.md with:

How month/year are stored in state and localStorage.

How manual transactions are appended and included everywhere in analytics.

Duplicate detection rule for subscriptions.

Definition of “essentials” vs “other” for the needs vs wants bar.

Tone guidance to keep wording simple and human.

9.3 Technical constraints and verification

No new dependencies beyond what is already in the project (Recharts is already there).

Styling stays consistent with:

Dark theme

Card layout

Existing animation feel

After implementing changes:

Run npm run lint and fix issues.

Manually verify:

Month/year controls regenerate statements and persist.

Manual transactions show up in all relevant tabs and survive refresh.

Recurring tab only shows duplicate hints when there are real duplicates.

Review tab shows:

Internal transfers card

Left-after-bills card

Bill check text

Needs vs wants bar with sensible percentages

Copy on Home, Dashboard, and About feels simple, human, and non-robotic.
