| Matching | 16 | Duke Energy, PG&E, Southern Company, FPL, Dominion, Con Edison, National Grid, Xcel, CenterPoint, Entergy, FirstEnergy, PPL, NV Energy, Georgia Power, Consumers Energy, Reliant |
| Placeholder Issue | 6 | "City of [YourTown]" entries in spec need generic replacements |
| Generic Names | 3 | Spectrum Utilities, Utility Billing Services, Regional Water/Gas |

**Issue:** Spec contains "City of [YourTown] Utilities/Water/Gas" placeholders. Implementation uses:
- "City Utilities"
- "City Water & Sewer"
- "City Gas"

**Recommendation:** Remove "[YourTown]" placeholders — current implementation is acceptable.

---

**Verdict:** Acceptable addition, aligns with realistic transaction patterns.

---

## Issues Requiring Action

### 1. "[YourTown]" Placeholders in Utilities Spec

The spec file `lifestyle_merchant_pools_v1.md` contains:
- "City of [YourTown] Utilities"
- "City of [YourTown] Water & Sewer"
- "City of [YourTown] Gas"

**Current Implementation:** Uses generic versions without "[YourTown]":
- "City Utilities"
- "City Water & Sewer"
- "City Gas"

**Recommendation:** Keep the implementation as-is. Update the spec to match (remove "[YourTown]" placeholders).

---

## Pool Size Verification

| Category | Spec Size | Code Size | Status |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Total Merchants | ~460 | 497 | ➕ Extra (Pharmacies) |

---

## Conclusion

**Merchant pool coverage is EXCELLENT.** The implementation matches the spec almost exactly with only minor naming simplifications and one bonus category (Pharmacies).

The only action item is updating the spec to remove "[YourTown]" placeholder text from the Utilities pool, or confirming the generic names are acceptable.
