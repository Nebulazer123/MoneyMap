I will do three things

List the current problems you just described, grouped by area

Merge that with the planned changes into a single ordered todo list

Suggest the next two Codex tasks so we stop thrashing

No code yet. Just planning.

1. Current problems you just reported

Home page

Hero and “How this demo works” cards are still the old copy and behavior

No hover or focus swap into Step style text

The “Learn more” overlay with the walkthrough is not implemented

Demo statement and edit behavior
4. Only one month selector works at a time, no from month to month range
5. There is only one Edit transactions button, not a second one under the Demo statement section
6. Edit transactions does not tie into Show statement and Hide statement correctly
• When you click Edit transactions, the statement does not auto expand
• When you click Done editing, the statement does not auto collapse and Hide statement is not triggered
7. Edit mode drops a little helper line under the month selector saying “Change categories here …” that you do not want to appear like that
8. Add transaction works, but the edit toggle around it is not behaving as the spec describes

Overview tab and pie chart
9. Subheading still says the more corporate wording, not “Where your money went this month”
10. “Click a category card to drill in” line is still present and should be removed
11. Pie chart is still relatively small, with a border and default colors that are not bold enough
12. Clicking the pie or around it shows white focus squares but no useful behavior
13. Pie categories are not condensed into grouped buckets for the chart
14. The Left after bills line still lives under the Overview spending card instead of only on Review
15. Pie labels still emphasize dollar amounts rather than percentage first

Recurring tab
16. Table only shows Subscriptions category, not other recurring bills and payments
17. Duplicate hint text and pill exist but may not match the planned wording

Daily cash flow
18. Tab and header still say Cash flow not Daily cash flow
19. No info icon beside the header
20. Row chevrons and per day drilldown are not implemented

Review tab
21. Internal transfers total is just a line of text, not a proper card in the snapshot layout
22. Left after bills is not exposed as its own card in the Review snapshot area
23. The bill check box copy is confusing and you are not sure what it means
24. Needs versus wants bar uses labels that are not intuitive for you (Essentials, Other)
25. Largest expense in the snapshot is not interactive yet

Transfer checks section
26. Still called Transfer checks, not Your accounts
27. Text still talks about switches, not account types
28. There are only Yes my account or No not mine controls, not the three state control we planned
29. No account type badge per row and no Add account flow

Data and categories
30. Fake statement data does not yet include the broader category set you want
31. Pie chart still has the old category layout, and you mentioned wanting an additional overall category count for the chart

New feature request you added now
32. Demo statement generation should support a month start and month end, with the generator creating transactions across that whole span
33. After analysis, the same month from and month to controls become a view filter rather than regenerating data
34. Regenerate statement button should be removed and Start over used as the only way to fully rerun the demo
35. You want that multi month range to be able to cover a long window, even if it means lots of rows

2. Consolidated todo list, chunked by area

I am folding the planned changes file and your complaints into one ordered backlog. Think of this as the map for Codex.

A. Demo statement and edit mode

A1. Fix Edit transactions and Show or Hide statement behavior

When statement is collapsed and you click Edit transactions, automatically show the statement and switch into edit mode

When you click Done editing, automatically collapse the statement and set the mode back to view

Stop dropping that small “Change categories here …” helper line, or move it into a calmer location inside the card copy if we keep it

Ensure both the top right button and the second Edit transactions control (below the analytics section) are present and in sync

A2. Wire AddTransactionRow correctly

Show AddTransactionRow only in edit mode under the Demo statement table

Inputs: date tied to selected month and year, description, category select, amount field with currency symbol outside

On Add: validate quietly, create a correct Transaction, append to state, persist to localStorage

Confirm all analytics recompute: Overview cards, Overview pie, Recurring, Fees, Daily cash flow, Review

A3. Multi month statement generation and view filter (new, bigger feature)

Replace single month selector with Month from and Month to controls that support a range

Update generateSampleStatement (or a new helper) so it can produce transactions across that whole range

On initial run: use Month from and Month to to build the statement, then analyze

After analysis, treat Month from and Month to as a view filter over the existing data, not a new generator

Remove the Regenerate statement button and rely on Start over for a full reset

Persist the selected range in localStorage and make sure AddTransactionRow still respects the range

This A3 block is large and should probably wait until the rest of Phase one is stable.

B. Overview tab and pie chart

B1. Copy and tile clean up

Change subheading text to “Where your money went this month” or the exact line from the planned changes

Remove the “Click a category card to drill in” helper line

Keep the existing tile set: Rent, Groceries, Dining, Subscriptions, Utilities or Bills, Fees, Transport, Other

B2. Pie chart design and grouping

Increase the pie chart size inside its card and remove any border ring that hides narrow slices

Use stronger distinct colors that still fit the dark theme

Condense chart data to grouped buckets:
• Rent plus Utilities
• Groceries plus Dining
• Transport
• Subscriptions
• Other including Fees and remaining categories

Ensure the legend or labels show percentage first and amount second

Move the Left after bills metric entirely out of the Overview card so it appears only on Review

Add interaction so clicking a slice or legend row shows the underlying detailed categories or opens the corresponding tile section

Remove the weird white square focus outlines by setting appropriate focus styles while keeping accessibility sane

B3. Make sure we still show full detailed categories in the tile grid beneath the pie even though the chart uses condensed groups

C. Recurring tab

C1. Scope and data

Include any repeating costs in the Recurring table: subscriptions, fixed bills, car or loan payments, credit card payments

Rename the Utilities style grouping to something like Bills and services in this context

Keep Subscriptions for more optional services

C2. Duplicate detection and copy

Ensure duplicate description detection is applied to all recurring rows

Confirm the hint text at the top and the “possible duplicate” pill match the wording from the planned changes

D. Daily cash flow tab

D1. Rename and copy

Change the tab label and section header from Cash flow to Daily cash flow

Subtitle: “Daily inflow and outflow for this month”

Add an info icon next to the header that explains in two short lines that it shows daily money in and out and ignores transfers between your own accounts

D2. Per day drilldown

Add a chevron on each date row

Clicking or pressing Enter or Space expands a sub row listing that day’s transactions with description and amount in the existing colors

Clicking again collapses it

Make sure the underlying aggregation math stays exactly the same

E. Review tab

E1. Snapshot grid and cards

Top row stays Snapshot, Subscriptions, Fees, Top spending categories

Add a second row with three portrait cards:
• Under Snapshot: “Internal transfers this month” card using the internal transfers total plus a one line description
• Under the center area: placeholder card with simple text for a future metric
• Under Top spending categories: “Left after bills” card using the existing essentials versus income metric

Make the titles of these cards slightly more visually strong using existing styling tokens

E2. Largest expense interaction

Make the largest expense line in the Fees or Snapshot area interactive

On click or hover, reveal a line showing the date, merchant, and amount

E3. Tooltip cleanup and wording

Review header tooltip should be a short explanation of what Review shows, not demo disclaimers

Keep Bill check sentences and Needs versus wants bar but simplify wording if needed

Possibly adjust labels Essentials and Other to something clearer while preserving the same math

F. Transfer checks to Your accounts

F1. Section rename and copy

Change heading to “Your accounts”

Replace the paragraph with one calm sentence and an info icon explaining this is where you mark which accounts are yours and how transfers are counted

F2. Account row contents

Add a type badge for each account row: Checking, Savings, Debit card, Credit card, Loan, Mortgage, Other

Replace the two button ownership choice with a three state control:
• Green: Spending account
• Orange: Payment account
• Neutral: Not mine

Update transfer logic so transfers between two Spending accounts are internal, and transfers to Payment accounts count as spending in the right place

F3. Add account flow

Add an “Add account” button

Flow: pick a representative transaction, auto match similar descriptions, show checkboxes, let user refine selection

User enters account name and type

Save a new account mapping and persist it

Ensure transfer logic and ownership map use this new mapping and that it survives refresh

This entire F block is big feature work and should follow after B through E are stable.

G. Home page

G1. Hero and disclosure

Keep the small “Phase one demo” label

Title MoneyMap

Tagline focused on stress testing spending without sharing real data

A single clean disclosure line saying the sample dashboard uses fake data only and never connects to real banks or stores statements

G2. “How this demo works” cards

Three cards with the titles you gave:
• Have a messy statement
• Run the clutter through MoneyMap
• See subscriptions and fees clearly

Default state shows friendly summary text

On hover or focus, each card enlarges slightly and swaps its body text into a “Step N” description from the planned changes

G3. Learn more overlay

Learn more opens a centered overlay with
• Headline “How this demo works”
• Slideable Step one, Step two, Step three cards
• A final slide “What you will see on your dashboard” with the Net, Income, Spending, Subscriptions bullets

Close button and click outside to dismiss

Keep the background subtle and readable

H. Data and categories

H1. Expand fake data coverage

In the generator, add a few more realistic spending categories or descriptions while keeping category mapping consistent

Make sure new data still maps into the existing Overview and Recurring categories and the condensed pie groups

I. Docs and wording polish

I1. Copy cleanup once features are done

Pass through src app page and src app dashboard page and remove any stiff or legal sounding text

Keep names like Budget guidance and Your accounts

Make all tooltips three short lines maximum with plain language

I2. Docs update

Update overview doc for
• Month and year controls
• Edit mode and add transaction
• Recurring duplicates
• Review bill check and Needs versus wants bar

Update dev notes for
• How month and year and ranges are stored
• How manual transactions and grouped descriptions are represented in state
• Duplicate detection rules
• Definitions for essentials versus other and budget targets
• Tone guidance so future contributors do not regress into legal copy

3. What to do next with Codex

Hard truth: if we attack everything at once, Codex will keep half implementing things and you will keep seeing this kind of mess.

Next sessions should be tiny slices.

Suggested next three Codex tasks, in order

Overview tab and pie chart (B1 and B2 only)
Fix the copy, remove the extra helper line, enlarge and restyle the pie, group categories, move Left after bills out of this card, and add slice click behavior. Do not touch anything else.

Demo statement edit behavior (A1 only)
Make Edit transactions and Done editing correctly expand and collapse the statement and sync with Show statement or Hide statement, including adding the second Edit button under the analytics area.

Daily cash flow rename and drilldown (D1 and D2)
Rename the tab, add the info icon, and implement per day drilldown with chevrons.

Once those three are in good shape and lint passes after each, we can tackle Review layout and Your accounts, then finally the large multi month range feature.

Reality check
The pie chart redesign plus condensed categories and click behavior is a medium chunk and easy to mess up visually, but it is contained to one card. The edit and show or hide behavior touches flow state and is easy to wire wrong if Codex touches too many flags at once. The multi month generator idea is a full feature on its own and will likely require touching fakeData helpers, state shape, localStorage keys, every analytics helper, and the UI. That one belongs after everything else is stable, or it will blow up the whole demo.
